# AN END-TO-END MACAQUE VOICEPRINT VERIFICATION METHOD BASED ON CHANNEL FUSION MECHANISM

**Abstract:** Primates are facing a serious survival crisis. Tracking the range of animal activities and population changes is of great significance for efficient animal protection. Primates are highly alert and inaccessible to humans. Therefore, it is difficult to track animals through direct observation, DNA fingerprinting, or marking methods. Primate recognition based on animal calls has the advantages of wide monitoring range, low equipment cost, and good concealment. In this work, we designed an effective macaque speech feature extraction structure based on a brain-like deep learning network, and innovatively proposed a feature fusion mechanism to effectively obtain the feature representation of each call. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the human auditory testing and the existing state-of-the-art human voiceprint verification algorithms in the experiments with different call durations. The accuracy of our macaque voiceprint verification algorithm reaches 93.81%.
